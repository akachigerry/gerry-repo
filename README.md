A couple bioinformatics tools still under development.
ASE-estimator is a tool under development. It is being designed for estimation of gene-level allele-specific expression (ASE) across the transcriptome of an indvidual and differential ASE across different treatments of same genotype.
The myAssembler tool is a de-novo genome assembler which tries to reconstruct a genome from NGS reads supplied in fastq file(s). It applies the classical de Bruijn graph but also implements methods which attempt to assemble repeats and improve contig length as a result.
